1.  Activation Keys

The first line of the input will be your raw activation key. It will consist of letters and numbers only
After that, until the "Generate" command is given, you will be receiving strings with instructions for different operations

Contains *substring* - If the raw activation key contains the given substring
Flip *upper/lower* *startIndex* *endIndex* - Changes the substring between the given indices to upper or lower case and then prints the activation key
Slice *startIndex* *endIndex* - Deletes the characters between the start and end indices (the end index is exclusive) and prints the activation key


2. Emoji Detector

Your task is to write a program that extracts emojis from a text and find the threshold based on the input
You have to get your cool threshold. It is obtained by multiplying all the digits found in the input
An emoji is valid when

It is surrounded by 2 characters, either "::" or "**"
It is at least 3 characters long (without the surrounding symbols)
It starts with a capital letter
Continues with lowercase letters only

You need to count all valid emojis in the text and calculate their coolness. The coolness of the emoji is determined by summing all the ASCII values of all letters in the emoji
You need to print the result of the cool threshold and, after that to take all emojis out of the text, count them and print only the cool ones on the console


3. Pirates

Until the "Sail" command is given, you will be receiving targeted cities, with their population and gold
After "Sail" you will start recieving events until "End"

Plunder *town* *people* *gold* - You have successfully attacked and plundered the town, killing the given number of people and stealing the respective amount of gold
Prosper *town* *gold* - There has been dramatic economic growth in the given city, increasing its treasury by the given amount of gold
If any of those two values (population or gold) reaches zero, the town is disbanded.
The gold amount can be a negative number, so be careful
