1. Password Reset

Write a password reset program that performs a series of commands upon a predefined string
First you will receive a string and afterward until the command "Done" is given, you will be receiving strings with commands.

TakeOdd - Takes only the characters at odd indices and concatenates them to obtain the new raw password
Cut *index* *length* - Gets the substring with the given length starting from the given index from the password and removes its first occurrence
Substitute *substring* *substitute* - If the raw password contains the given substring, replaces all of its occurrences with the substitute text given


2. Fancy Barcode

Your first task is to determine if the given sequence of characters is a valid barcode or not.
Each line must not contain anything else but a valid barcode.
A barcode is valid when: It is surrounded by a "@" followed by one or more "#"
It is at least 6 characters long (without the surrounding "@" or "#")
It starts with a capital letter
It contains only letters (lower and upper case) and digits
It ends with a capital letter
Determine the product group of the item from the barcode. The product group is obtained by concatenating all the digits found in the barcode
If there are no digits present in the barcode, the default product group is "00"


3. Heroes of Code and Logic

On the first line of the standard input, you will receive an integer n â€“ the number of heroes that you can choose for your party
On the next n lines, the heroes themselves will follow with their hit points and mana points (a hero can have a maximum of 100 HP and 200 MP)
After you have successfully picked your heroes, you can start playing the game. You will be receiving different commands until "End"

CastSpell *heroname* *MPneeded* *spellname* - If the hero has the required MP, he casts the spell, thus reducing his MP
TakeDamage *heroname* *damage* *attacker* - Reduce the hero HP by the given damage amount. If the hero is still alive
Recharge *heroname* *amount* - The hero increases his MP. If it brings the MP of the hero above the maximum value (200), MP is increased to 200.
Heal *heroname* *amount* - The hero increases his HP. If a command is given that would bring the HP of the hero above the maximum value (100), HP is increased to 100
